# 🚀 Deployment & Multi-Agency Profile Questions - ANSWERED

## ✅ Question: Will All Profiles Use This Same Template?

**YES!** All agency profiles will use the same `/companies/[id].astro` template.

### How It Works:

```javascript
// The template is dynamic
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const companies = await getCollection('companies');
  return companies.map((company) => ({
    params: { id: company.data.id },  // prime-relocation, anchor-relocation, etc.
    props: { company },
  }));
}
```

**Result:**
- `/companies/prime-relocation` ✅
- `/companies/anchor-relocation` ✅
- `/companies/auris-relocation` ✅
- `/companies/executive-relocation` ✅
- ... all 36 companies ✅

## 📊 Will All Have Reviews & AI Function?

### **Reviews Display:**

**Depends on data in database:**

| Agency | Google Reviews? | Will Show Reviews? |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Prime Relocation | ✅ 62 reviews | ✅ YES |
| Anchor Relocation | ✅ 32 reviews | ✅ YES |
| Auris Relocation | ✅ 163 reviews | ✅ YES |
| Executive Relocation | ✅ 1 review | ✅ YES |
| Contentum Relocation | ❌ No data | ❌ Shows "No reviews yet" |

**Logic:**
```javascript
{(internalReviews.length > 0 || externalAggregate.count > 0) ? (
  // Show reviews
) : (
  // Show "No reviews yet" empty state
)}
```

### **AI Function:**

**Works for ANY agency with reviews!**

```
Has reviews in external_reviews table?
  ✅ YES → AI Analysis button appears & works
  ❌ NO → AI Analysis button appears but returns "Not enough reviews"
```

**Currently Working For:**
- ✅ Prime Relocation (62 reviews)
- ✅ Anchor Relocation (32 reviews)
- ✅ Auris Relocation (163 reviews)
- ✅ Executive Relocation (1 review - but AI needs min 1)
- ✅ All others with `google_place_id` set

## 🔧 How to Set Tiers for Each Agency

**Run this SQL in Supabase:**

```sql
-- Set Prime as Preferred
UPDATE relocators 
SET tier = 'preferred', 
    meeting_url = 'https://cal.com/primerelocation/relofinder',
    can_reply_to_reviews = true
WHERE name ILIKE '%prime%';

-- Set as Partner
UPDATE relocators 
SET tier = 'partner',
    can_reply_to_reviews = true
WHERE name IN ('Auris Relocation', 'Executive Relocation', 'Anchor Relocation');

-- Set as Standard (default)
UPDATE relocators 
SET tier = 'standard',
    can_reply_to_reviews = false
WHERE name IN ('Contentum Relocation', 'Lodge Relocation');

-- Verify
SELECT name, tier, meeting_url FROM relocators ORDER BY tier DESC, name;
```

   - Company data from content collections
   - Reviews from Supabase (fetched at build time)
   - Proper tier logic (fetched at build time)
