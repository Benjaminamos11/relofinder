## 🔧 Testing Steps

### 1. Refresh the Page
```
http://localhost:4321/companies/prime-relocation
```

### 2. Scroll to Reviews Section
- Should show: "★ 62" total reviews
- Should show: "Total reviews from Google, ReloFinder and verified sources"
- Should show: 8 Google review cards below

### 3. Click "Get AI Summary of the Reviews"
- Panel should expand
- Loading animation should start
- Progress text should update 3 times

### 4. Watch the Terminal
You should see console logs:
```
Fetched 0 internal reviews
Extracted 8 Google reviews from payload
Total reviews to analyze: 8, Total count: 62, Avg rating: 4.80
OpenAI API key configured: true
Sending 8 reviews to OpenAI for analysis...
OpenAI response status: 200
OpenAI returned XXX characters
Successfully parsed OpenAI JSON response
Returning insights for 62 reviews with 4 themes
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Button Does Nothing:
**Check Terminal** for:
```
[WARN] [router] /api/reviews/insights POST requests are not available
```
**Fix**: Already added `export const prerender = false;` to the API file.

### If Returns Empty Themes:
**Check Terminal** for:
```
OpenAI API key configured: false
```
**Fix**: Verify `.env` has:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-SKHi...
```

### If Shows Placeholder Instead of Real Analysis:
**Check Terminal** for the review count:
```
Total reviews to analyze: 0
```
**Fix**: The reviews aren't being extracted from payload. Run this SQL:
```sql
SELECT jsonb_typeof(payload->'user_reviews'->'most_relevant') 
FROM external_reviews 
WHERE relocator_id = (SELECT id FROM relocators WHERE name ILIKE '%prime%')
ORDER BY captured_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```
