## 🚀 How to Test

### **1. Test the Edge Function Directly:**

Run this in your terminal:
```bash
curl -X POST https://yrkdgsswjnrrprfsmllr.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-ai-summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inlya2Rnc3N3am5ycnByZnNtbGxyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzU5MTU4MzIsImV4cCI6MjA1MTQ5MTgzMn0.7BlX7lS9eOesqW7TAAAAKlc068Ria-7rCjOwvaywctE" \
  -d '{"relocator_id":"96ee3343-4a8e-4972-bab5-31c62d6ec178"}'
```

### **2. Check Supabase Logs:**

Go to:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yrkdgsswjnrrprfsmllr/functions/generate-ai-summary/logs
```

Look for:
```
Fetching reviews for relocator_id: 96ee3343-4a8e-4972-bab5-31c62d6ec178
Fetched 0 internal reviews
Stats: internal=0, external=62, total=62
External Google data: Found
OpenAI request sent for 8 reviews, waiting for response...
AI Verdict: Clients frequently praise...
Consultants mentioned: ["Sabine de Potter", "Julie Poirier", "Heike"]
```

### **3. Test from the Website:**

```
http://localhost:4321/companies/prime-relocation
```

1. Scroll to Reviews section
2. Click **"Get AI Summary of the Reviews"**
3. Wait for loading animation
4. Check browser console for logs
5. See if results appear

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If Still Shows "No themes identified":**

**Check the Supabase logs** for these potential issues:

1. **"Failed to fetch reviews"** 
   - Issue: RLS policies or column names
   - Fix: Run the SQL I provided earlier to check table structure

2. **"Not enough reviews"**
   - Issue: No reviews found in database
   - Check: We have 62 Google reviews in `external_reviews` table

3. **"OpenAI API error: Unauthorized"**
   - Issue: API key not set in Supabase secrets
   - Fix: Set the OpenAI key in Supabase Edge Function secrets

4. **"Invalid AI response"**
   - Issue: OpenAI didn't return expected JSON
   - Check: Console logs for actual response

---

##  **Next: Set OpenAI Key in Supabase**

The Edge Function needs the OpenAI API key set as a secret:

### **Go to:**
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yrkdgsswjnrrprfsmllr/settings/functions
```

### **Add Secret:**
- Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Value: `[Your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys]`

Then click **Save**.
