## 🔍 SEO IMPROVEMENTS MADE

### Structured Data Fixed
**Problem:** `/services/housing/zurich` had no schema enhancements according to Google

**Solution:**
1. Combined all schemas into `@graph` format
2. Added schemas: BreadcrumbList, Service, FAQPage, Place
3. Pass through Layout props (not inline components)
4. Added canonical URL
5. Added relevant keywords array

**Now includes:**
- ✅ BreadcrumbList schema
- ✅ Service schema (with provider, areaServed)
- ✅ FAQPage schema (6 detailed Q&As)
- ✅ Place schema (for Zurich location)
- ✅ Proper `@graph` format for multiple schemas
