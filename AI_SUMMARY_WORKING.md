## 🧠 AI Integration

### Data Sources:
1. **Internal Reviews** (from `reviews` table)
2. **External Reviews** (from `external_reviews.payload`)
3. **Calculated Metrics**:
   - Weighted average rating (60% internal + 40% external)
   - Total review count
   - Positive percentage (4+ stars)

### API Endpoint: `/api/reviews/insights`
**Input:**
```json
{
  "agencyId": "96ee3343-4a8e-4972-bab5-31c62d6ec178",
  "agencyName": "Prime Relocation",
  "reviews": []
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "summary": "Clients praise professionalism...",
  "themes": ["Service Quality", "Communication", "Local Knowledge"],
  "strengths": ["Experienced team", "Comprehensive support"],
  "watchouts": ["Contact for requirements"],
  "quotes": ["Great experience moving to Zurich"],
  "totalReviews": 62,
  "averageRating": "4.8",
  "positivePercentage": "94%"
}
```

### Fallback Strategy:
- **No OpenAI key**: Returns smart placeholder based on actual data
- **API error**: Returns fallback insights
- **No reviews**: Returns "More insights coming soon"
