Keep it open to see what's happening.

### **Step 4: Click the Red Button**
When you click, immediately check the console. You should see logs like:
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Button Does Nothing:**

**Check Console for:**
```
Error: [some error message]
```

**Common Fixes:**
1. Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R`
2. Clear Site Data in DevTools
3. Try incognito window

### **If Panel Shows "Unable to generate insights":**

**Check Console Error Message**. It will tell you exactly what went wrong.

**Then check:**
1. Network tab - did the request to Supabase complete?
2. Response tab - what did the Edge Function return?
3. Supabase logs - did OpenAI respond?

### **If Loading Never Finishes:**

The Edge Function might be timing out. Check Supabase logs at:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yrkdgsswjnrrprfsmllr/functions/generate-ai-summary/logs
```

Look for errors like:
- "OpenAI API error"
- "Timeout"
- "Failed to..."
