> "As my relocation to Zürich and start of work was extremely short notice (less than 4 weeks) it would have been completely impossible to get housing, insurances, registrations, etc and all other organisational mattes done without the help of Bettina and Claudia. I absolutely recommend them for anybody required to relocate to Zürich, especially from outside of Switzerland."
