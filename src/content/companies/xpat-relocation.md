# About
Xpat Relocation was founded in 2018 by Marianne Blommers-Poggio Voormolen, drawing upon her personal experience moving from the Netherlands to Switzerland in 2011 with her family. Having navigated the challenges of finding a home, schools, and completing paperwork without professional help, Marianne combined this firsthand understanding with over 10 years of working in the relocation field to create an agency dedicated to making the transition smoother for other expats.

The team, including fellow experienced expat Nicole Schenkelaars, focuses on providing comprehensive support from the initial call to the final handover. They pride themselves on understanding the practical challenges expats face and offer both structured packages and flexible a-la-carte services. Their multilingual team (Dutch, Spanish, French, German, English) caters to a diverse international clientele moving to the Zug, Luzern, and Zurich areas.
