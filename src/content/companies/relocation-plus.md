> "I have now worked with Nicole three times for her relocation services. In each instance, she helped me quickly find and secure a suitable apartment when limited options were available.

Her support has been invaluable and I am very grateful."
> — Laura Ory, Business Consultant for Biopharma and Diagnostic Companies

# FAQ
## Does Relocation Plus require clients to purchase a complete package of services?
No, Relocation Plus offers a flexible approach where clients can pick and choose only the specific services they need. Whether you only need help finding a place to live, assistance with integration, or support selling your property, they can tailor their services to your requirements without requiring you to purchase a comprehensive package.

## How does Relocation Plus's integration service work?
Relocation Plus offers a personalized one-year Q&A service for integration support. They recognize that questions about local life don't all arise at once but emerge gradually as you settle in. During this period, you can ask questions about driver's license exchanges, waste management, spouse support, public transportation, shopping, language courses, and other aspects of daily life in Switzerland.

## What languages does the Relocation Plus team speak?
The Relocation Plus team is multilingual, with consultants speaking English, German, Swiss-German, French, Spanish, and Dutch. This allows them to assist clients in the language they feel most comfortable using. Nicole Schenkelaars herself speaks six languages: Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, and some Italian.

## Does Relocation Plus work with both individuals and corporate clients?
Yes, Relocation Plus serves both individual relocators and corporate clients. They have experience handling large group moves for international companies in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, banking, technology, and food manufacturing. Their services can be scaled to accommodate both individual needs and corporate relocation programs.

## Can Relocation Plus help with departure from Switzerland as well?
Yes, Relocation Plus offers comprehensive departure services for those leaving Switzerland. This includes assistance with canceling rental and other contracts, de-registering with authorities, finding replacement tenants if needed, organizing end-cleaning, selecting moving companies, ensuring rental deposit reimbursement, and assisting with property handover inspections.
