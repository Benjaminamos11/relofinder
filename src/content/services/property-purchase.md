# Swiss Property Acquisition for High-Net-Worth Individuals

Switzerland's pristine landscapes, political stability, security, and discretion make it a highly desirable location for luxury property ownership. However, acquiring Swiss real estate as a foreign national involves navigating complex regulations, particularly the Lex Koller legislation, and understanding the tax implications, including lump-sum taxation opportunities.

## Understanding Lex Koller Restrictions

The Swiss federal law on the acquisition of real estate by persons abroad, commonly known as Lex Koller, places significant restrictions on foreign nationals wishing to purchase property in Switzerland.

### Core Restrictions

- Foreign nationals without a Swiss residence permit (C permit) generally cannot purchase residential properties
- Purchase of commercial properties is typically permitted without special authorization
- Holiday homes in designated tourist areas may be available with cantonal quotas and restrictions
- Agricultural land and undeveloped land face the strictest limitations

### Permitted Pathways for Foreign Buyers

Despite these restrictions, several legitimate pathways exist for high-net-worth individuals to acquire Swiss property:

#### Residence Permit Holders
- EU/EFTA nationals with Swiss residence can purchase primary residences without Lex Koller restrictions
- Non-EU/EFTA nationals with C permits (permanent residence) face minimal restrictions
- B permit holders (temporary residence) can purchase a primary residence for personal use

#### Commercial Property Investment
- Commercial-use properties can be acquired with fewer restrictions
- Mixed-use properties may qualify with proper structuring
- Commercial investment can include hotel properties and serviced apartments in some cases

#### Corporate Structures
- Swiss legal entities with appropriate structures may facilitate property acquisition
- Careful planning with expert legal guidance is essential

## Lump-Sum Taxation Benefits

Switzerland's lump-sum taxation system (Pauschalbesteuerung) offers significant advantages for wealthy foreign nationals who establish residence in Switzerland but don't engage in local employment.

### How Pauschalsteuer Works

- Taxation based on living expenses rather than worldwide income or assets
- Typically calculated as five to seven times the annual rental value of the residence
- Minimum taxable income thresholds vary by canton, ranging from CHF 250,000 to CHF 600,000
- No obligation to declare worldwide income or assets
- Simplified tax filing and administration

### Cantonal Variations

Different cantons offer varying terms for lump-sum taxation arrangements:

- **Geneva**: Minimum taxable income of CHF 400,000
- **Valais**: Minimum of CHF 220,000, among the most competitive
- **Vaud (Lausanne region)**: Minimum of CHF 360,000
- **Graubünden (St. Moritz)**: Competitive rates for high-value residents
- **Bern (Gstaad)**: Attractive terms for ultra-high-net-worth individuals
- **Zug**: Combines lump-sum option with already low cantonal tax rates

### Connecting Taxation and Property

Strategic property acquisition in cantons with favorable lump-sum taxation terms can optimize your overall financial position:

- Residence in tax-efficient cantons like Valais or Graubünden
- Property value impacts the lump-sum calculation
- Proper structuring maximizes benefits while ensuring compliance
