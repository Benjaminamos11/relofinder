faq:
  - question: "How far in advance should I plan my departure from Switzerland?"
    answer: "For a smooth departure, begin planning 3-6 months before your intended leaving date. Rental agreements typically require 3 months' notice, utilities need cancellation, and deregistration from local authorities must be completed. Our departure services create a customized timeline based on your specific situation."
  - question: "What happens to my Swiss pension contributions when I leave Switzerland?"
    answer: "When leaving Switzerland permanently, you may be eligible to withdraw your pension funds from the second pillar (occupational pension). Rules vary depending on where you're relocating to (EU/EFTA countries have different regulations). Our repatriation specialists can explain your options and assist with the withdrawal process."
  - question: "Will I need to file a final tax return in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Yes, you'll need to file a final tax return covering the period from January 1st until your departure date. This is known as a 'departure tax return' and must be submitted within 30 days of leaving. Our departure services include coordination with tax advisors to ensure proper tax deregistration and compliance."
