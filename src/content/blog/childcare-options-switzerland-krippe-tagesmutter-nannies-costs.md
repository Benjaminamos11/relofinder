## 🙋‍♀️ FAQ: Childcare in Switzerland for Expats

**Q1: How do I get on a waiting list for a Krippe in Switzerland?**

A: Contact crèches directly as early as possible (even before your move if you know your approximate location/arrival). Many have online application forms for their waiting lists. Some cities or communes have central waiting list systems. Apply to multiple facilities to maximize your chances.

**Q2: Are childcare costs tax-deductible in Switzerland?**

A: Yes, a certain amount of documented childcare costs for children up to a certain age (usually 14) can be deducted from your taxable income at both federal and cantonal levels, provided both parents (or a single parent) are working, studying, or unable to care for the children. The maximum deductible amounts vary by canton. Keep all receipts!

**Q3: What are the typical staff-to-child ratios in Swiss crèches?**

A: Ratios are regulated by cantonal authorities and vary by age. For babies, it might be around 1 caregiver to 3-4 infants. For older toddlers/preschoolers, it could be 1 to 8-12 children. These ratios are strictly enforced and are often better than international standards.

**Q4: Do childcare providers in Switzerland offer bilingual options?**

A: Many private crèches and international-focused childcare centers, especially in larger cities, offer bilingual programs (e.g., local language + English, or German/French). Public/subsidized crèches primarily operate in the local language, which provides excellent immersion opportunities.

**Q5: What should I look for in a childcare contract?**

A: Key elements include: precise costs and what they cover, payment terms and methods, opening/closing hours and holiday schedules, policy on sick days (for child or staff), notice period for terminating the contract, emergency procedures, and any additional fees for activities or materials.

**Q6: How do childcare subsidies work in Switzerland?**

A: Subsidies are typically income-based and administered by local communes. You'll need to provide detailed financial documentation including tax returns, pay slips, and proof of residency. The subsidy amount depends on your income, family size, and local policies. Applications should be submitted as early as possible.

**Q7: What happens if my child gets sick at childcare?**

A: Most facilities have strict illness policies to prevent spreading infections. You'll typically be called to collect your child immediately if they develop a fever or symptoms. Children usually cannot return until they've been symptom-free for 24-48 hours. Some facilities require a doctor's note for certain illnesses.

**Q8: Can I visit a crèche or Tagesmutter before enrolling my child?**

A: Absolutely, and it's highly recommended! Most quality providers welcome visits and will be happy to show you around, explain their approach, and answer questions. This is your opportunity to assess whether the environment feels right for your child and family.
