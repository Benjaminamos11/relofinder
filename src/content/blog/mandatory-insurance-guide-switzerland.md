Relocating involves two types of paperwork: The paperwork to get *in* (Visas/Permits), and the paperwork to stay *safe* (Insurance).

While [ReloFinder](/companies) helps you find the agency to manage your move, navigating the Swiss insurance jungle requires specialized advice.

## The Safety Net: Executive Summary

| Insurance Type | Status | Deadline | Why It Matters |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Health (LAMal/KVG)** | Mandatory | 3 months after arrival | Cannot access healthcare without it |
| **Liability (Privathaftpflicht)** | Required for renting | Before signing lease | Landlords won't rent without it |
| **Household (Hausrat)** | Highly recommended | Before moving in | Protects your belongings |

**Key Insight:** Don't let insurance be an afterthought. Secure your Liability Insurance *before* you start viewing apartments, and sort your Health Insurance as soon as you have your address.

---

## 1. Health Insurance (The Big One)

Swiss healthcare is excellent but expensive. Unlike most countries, health insurance is **not deducted from your salary** — you pay it privately.

### The Legal Requirement

Under the Swiss Federal Health Insurance Act (LAMal/KVG), everyone living in Switzerland must have basic health insurance. No exceptions.

| Fact | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who must enroll** | Everyone with a Swiss residence permit |
| **Deadline** | 3 months from arrival date |
| **Coverage start** | Retroactive to your arrival date |
| **Consequence of non-compliance** | Canton assigns you a provider at higher rates |

### What LAMal Covers

Basic health insurance in Switzerland covers:

- **Doctor visits** (GP and specialists)
- **Hospital stays** (general ward)
- **Medications** (on the approved list)
- **Maternity care** (no deductible)
- **Emergency care**
- **Rehabilitation**
- **Mental health treatment**

### What LAMal Does NOT Cover

- **Dental care** (except accidents)
- **Vision** (glasses, contacts)
- **Alternative medicine** (acupuncture, homeopathy)
- **Private hospital rooms**
- **Worldwide coverage** (outside Switzerland)

For these, you need **supplementary insurance** (Zusatzversicherung).

### Cost Factors

Swiss health insurance premiums vary significantly based on:

| Factor | Impact on Premium |
|--------|------------------|
| **Canton** | Premiums in Geneva are 50% higher than in Appenzell |
| **Provider** | Same coverage, different prices — always compare |
| **Franchise (Deductible)** | CHF 300-2,500/year — higher deductible = lower premium |
| **Model** | Telmed/HMO models cost 10-25% less than Standard |
| **Age** | Adults pay full rates; children and young adults have reduced rates |

### Typical Monthly Premiums (2026)

| Profile | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Adult (Standard model, CHF 300 franchise)** | CHF 350 | CHF 500 |
| **Adult (Telmed model, CHF 2,500 franchise)** | CHF 200 | CHF 320 |
| **Child (under 18)** | CHF 80 | CHF 150 |
| **Family of 4** | CHF 800 | CHF 1,400 |

## 2. Private Liability Insurance (The Key to Housing)

You cannot sign a rental contract in Switzerland without **Privathaftpflichtversicherung** (private liability insurance).

### Why It's Required

Swiss landlords universally require proof of liability insurance before signing a lease. This protects both parties:

| What It Covers | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| **Damage to rental property** | Scratching parquet floors, water damage from overflowing bath |
| **Damage to neighbors** | Your washing machine floods the apartment below |
| **Accidental injury to others** | Your child damages someone's property |
| **Legal defense costs** | If someone sues you for damages |

### What It Does NOT Cover

- **Intentional damage** (obviously)
- **Professional liability** (need separate business insurance)
- **Car accidents** (covered by auto insurance)
- **Your own belongings** (that's household insurance)

### Cost

Liability insurance is remarkably affordable:

| Coverage Level | Annual Premium |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Basic (CHF 3M coverage)** | CHF 60-100/year |
| **Standard (CHF 5M coverage)** | CHF 80-150/year |
| **Premium (CHF 10M coverage)** | CHF 120-200/year |

**For roughly CHF 10/month, you get CHF 5 million in coverage.** There's no reason not to have it.

### When to Get It

**Before you start viewing apartments.**

Many landlords ask for proof of liability insurance during the application process — not just at signing. Having it ready signals you're a prepared, responsible tenant.

## 3. Household Contents Insurance (Hausratversicherung)

If your apartment burns down or you're robbed, the landlord's building insurance covers the structure — but **not your belongings**.

### What It Covers

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Fire damage** | Your furniture, electronics, clothes destroyed in fire |
| **Water damage** | Burst pipe ruins your belongings |
| **Theft** | Break-in, robbery |
| **Natural disasters** | Storm damage, flooding |
| **Vandalism** | Damage by third parties |

### What It Does NOT Cover

- **Gradual wear and tear**
- **Damage you cause yourself**
- **Items stored outside your home** (unless specified)
- **Cash above certain limits**

### Cost Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Insured value** | How much your belongings are worth |
| **Location** | Some areas have higher theft/flood risk |
| **Deductible** | Higher deductible = lower premium |
| **Add-ons** | Bicycle theft, glass breakage, etc. |

### Typical Costs

| Coverage Amount | Annual Premium |
|----------------|----------------|
| **CHF 50,000** | CHF 100-150/year |
| **CHF 100,000** | CHF 150-250/year |
| **CHF 200,000** | CHF 250-400/year |

### Pro Tip: Bundle It

Most Swiss insurers offer combined packages:

**"Household + Liability" bundles** typically cost 15-20% less than buying separately.

**Example:** CHF 180/year for CHF 75,000 household + CHF 5M liability coverage.

## The Insurance Timeline

Here's when to handle each insurance during your relocation:

| Phase | Insurance Action |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Before apartment search** | Get liability insurance (required for applications) |
| **Upon arrival** | Start health insurance research |
| **Within 1 month** | Decide on household insurance |
| **Within 3 months** | Finalize and enroll in health insurance |
| **Move-in day** | Ensure all policies are active |

## Common Expat Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting Until You're Sick

**The Problem:** You arrive, feel fine, delay getting health insurance. Then you get injured.

**The Reality:** Without insurance, a simple ER visit costs CHF 2,000+. A hospital stay: CHF 10,000+/day.

**The Fix:** Enroll in LAMal within the first month, not the third.

### Mistake 2: Choosing the Cheapest Option

**The Problem:** You pick the lowest premium without understanding the trade-offs.

**The Reality:** A CHF 2,500 franchise means you pay the first CHF 2,500 of medical costs out-of-pocket each year.

**The Fix:** If you're healthy and rarely see doctors, high franchise works. If you have chronic conditions or a family, choose lower franchise.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Supplementary Insurance

**The Problem:** You skip Zusatzversicherung to save money.

**The Reality:** Need glasses? Dental work? Want a private room? None covered.

**The Fix:** Consider basic supplementary packages (often just CHF 20-50/month).

### Mistake 4: Not Bundling

**The Problem:** You buy liability and household insurance from different providers.

**The Reality:** You're paying more and dealing with multiple policies.

**The Fix:** Bundle household + liability with one provider for savings and simplicity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is health insurance mandatory in Switzerland?

Yes. Swiss law (LAMal/KVG) requires everyone living in Switzerland to have basic health insurance. You must enroll within 3 months of arrival, and coverage is retroactive to your arrival date. There are no exceptions for employed or self-employed individuals.

### How much does Swiss health insurance cost?

Basic health insurance premiums range from CHF 250-450 per month for adults, depending on your canton (Geneva is most expensive, Appenzell least), chosen provider, deductible level (CHF 300-2,500), and insurance model (standard, telmed, or HMO). For personalized quotes, consult [Expat-Savvy.ch](https://expat-savvy.ch).

### What is Privathaftpflicht and why do I need it?

Privathaftpflicht is private liability insurance. It covers damage you accidentally cause to others' property or persons — like scratching a landlord's parquet floor or your child breaking a neighbor's window. Swiss landlords require proof of liability insurance before signing any rental contract. Compare providers at [Insurance-Guide.ch](https://insurance-guide.ch).

### What's the difference between LAMal and supplementary insurance?

**LAMal (basic insurance)** is mandatory and covers essential medical care: doctor visits, hospital stays (general ward), medications, and emergencies.

**Supplementary insurance** is optional and covers extras: private hospital rooms, dental care, vision (glasses/contacts), alternative medicine, and worldwide coverage for travel.

### Can my employer provide health insurance in Switzerland?

Unlike the US, UK, or many other countries, Swiss employers do **not** provide health insurance. You must arrange and pay for it privately. Some employers offer group rates or premium subsidies as a benefit, but you're still responsible for enrollment and payment.

### What happens if I don't get health insurance within 3 months?

If you don't enroll within 3 months, your canton will assign you to a provider — often at a higher premium and with less favorable conditions. Coverage will be backdated to your arrival date, meaning you'll owe premiums from day one regardless.
