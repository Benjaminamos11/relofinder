## 📋 The Swiss Rental Contract (Mietvertrag): Key Elements to Scrutinize

While many rental contracts in Switzerland use standardized forms, it's vital to read every clause carefully before signing. Here are the essential components:

### **1. 👥 Parties Involved and Property Details**

**📝 Essential Information:**
- **Landlord (Vermieter / Bailleur) & Tenant (Mieter / Locataire):** Full names and addresses of all parties
- **Joint Responsibility:** If multiple tenants are listed, they are usually jointly responsible
- **Property Description:** Exact address, floor, number of rooms (remember the Swiss counting system)
- **Included Spaces:** Cellar compartment (Kellerabteil), attic (Estrich), parking space

**💡 Pro Tip:** Verify that all included spaces are specifically mentioned in the contract to avoid disputes later.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions: Swiss Rental Rights

### **Q1: Can my landlord enter my apartment without permission?**
**A:** **Absolutely not.** Your landlord must obtain your permission and provide reasonable notice for any entry (inspections, repairs, viewings). Entry without permission is only permissible in genuine emergencies (fire, major water leak, immediate safety threats). Your privacy rights are strongly protected under Swiss law.

### **Q2: What qualifies as a "minor repair" that I must pay for?**
**A:** **Minor repairs** are small maintenance items you can handle yourself without specialist knowledge, typically costing **CHF 150-200 or less**. Examples include:
- Light bulbs and fuse replacement
- Shower hoses and toilet seats
- Loose door handles or cabinet knobs
- Basic caulking touch-ups

**Major repairs** (structural, electrical systems, plumbing) are always the landlord's responsibility unless you caused damage through negligence.

### **Q3: How can I contest an unfair rent increase?**
**A:** You have **30 days** from receiving the rent increase notice to appeal to your local **Cantonal Conciliation Authority**. The increase must be justified by:
- Changes in mortgage reference interest rates
- Inflation adjustments within legal limits
- Significant property improvements

**Tenant associations** can help evaluate whether an increase is contestable and assist with the appeal process.

### **Q4: Do I need professional cleaning when moving out?**
**A:** **It depends on your contract terms and move-in condition.** If your contract specifies **"professional cleaning with acceptance guarantee"** or the apartment was professionally cleaned when you moved in, then yes. Otherwise, you must return the apartment in the same cleanliness level as when you received it. Many tenants choose professional cleaning with guarantees to avoid disputes.

### **Q5: Can I break my lease early without penalty?**
**A:** **Generally, you're liable for rent until the next official termination date.** However, you can be released if you provide **at least one solvent and acceptable replacement tenant** (Nachmieter) willing to take over your lease under identical terms. The landlord cannot unreasonably refuse a suitable replacement.

### **Q6: What if my landlord refuses to maintain the property?**
**A:** **Take these steps:**
1. **Document the problem** with photos and written descriptions
2. **Notify landlord in writing** via registered mail with repair timeline
3. **Contact tenant association** for advice
4. **File complaint** with Conciliation Authority if landlord fails to act
5. **Consider rent reduction** or deposit withholding for serious issues

### **Q7: Are there limits on rental deposits in Switzerland?**
**A:** **Yes, strict limits apply:**
- **Maximum 3 months' net rent** for residential properties
- **Must be deposited** in special account in tenant's name
- **Cannot be cash** held directly by landlord
- **Interest accrues** to tenant's benefit
- **Both signatures required** for fund release
