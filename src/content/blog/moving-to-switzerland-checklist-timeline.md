faqs:
  - question: "How far in advance should I start planning my move to Switzerland?"

  - question: "What is Form 18.44 for Swiss customs?"
    answer: "Form 18.44 is the customs declaration for importing household goods duty-free when relocating to Switzerland. You must complete it before shipping your belongings and present it at customs. It lists all items you're importing."
  - question: "How long do I have to register after arriving in Switzerland?"
    answer: "You must register at your local municipality (Gemeinde/Kreisbüro) within 14 days of arrival. Bring your passport, rental contract, and employment contract. You'll receive your residence permit after registration."
  - question: "When should I start looking for housing in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Start 2-3 months before your move date. In competitive markets like Zürich, the housing search is the longest phase. Register on Offlist.ch immediately to access off-market inventory and maximize your timeline."
  - question: "What should I do in my first week in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Priority tasks: Register at municipality (within 14 days), open a bank account, get a Swiss phone number, buy an SBB travel card, and start your health insurance enrollment process. Most can be done in the first few days."
  - question: "Do I need temporary housing when moving to Switzerland?"
    answer: "If you haven't secured permanent housing via Offlist.ch or an agency, book a 'business apartment' or serviced apartment for your first 1-2 months. This gives you a local address for registration and time to continue your search."

Relocating is 80% logistics and 20% emotion. To ensure the emotion is "Excitement" and not "Panic," you need a plan.

Here is the master checklist used by professional relocation agencies.

---

## Timeline Overview

| Phase | When | Focus Area |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | 3 Months Out | Permits, home country wind-down |
| **Phase 2** | 2 Months Out | Housing search begins |
| **Phase 3** | 1 Month Out | Logistics, temporary housing |
| **Phase 4** | Arrival Week | Registration, banking, settling in |

---

## Phase 1: 3 Months Before Departure

### Permits & Legal

- [ ] **Check permit eligibility** — EU vs. Non-EU rules differ significantly
- [ ] **Confirm employer is handling permit application** — Most employers manage this
- [ ] **Gather required documents** — Passport, employment contract, diplomas, marriage/birth certificates
- [ ] **Apostille important documents** — Some countries require this for Swiss recognition

### Home Country Wind-Down

- [ ] **Cancel gym memberships** — Many require 3 months' notice
- [ ] **Notify internet/cable providers** — Check cancellation terms
- [ ] **Cancel utility contracts** — Electricity, gas, water
- [ ] **Notify landlord** — Standard notice periods apply
- [ ] **Cancel or transfer subscriptions** — Streaming, magazines, newspapers
- [ ] **Notify tax authorities** — You're leaving the country

### Start Your Research

- [ ] **Request relocation quotes** — Use [ReloFinder](/companies) to get anonymous quotes from 3+ agencies
- [ ] **Research health insurance options** — Read guides on [Expat-Savvy.ch](https://expat-savvy.ch) to understand franchise/deductible trade-offs
- [ ] **Research schools** (if applicable) — International schools have waiting lists

### Pro Tip

> Confused by paperwork? The **[Expat-Services.ch](https://expat-services.ch)** AI Agent can draft motivation letters for migration offices and explain cantonal requirements.

## Phase 2: 2 Months Before Departure

### Housing — The Critical Phase

This is the bottleneck. Start now.

- [ ] **Register on Offlist.ch** — Create your verified profile immediately

> **Action:** Register on **[Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch)** now. Create your profile so you're visible to landlords and agencies *before* you arrive. This is the most effective way to access hidden inventory.

- [ ] **Set your housing criteria** — Size, location, budget, must-haves
- [ ] **Get liability insurance** — Required for rental applications

> **Tip:** Swiss landlords often ask for liability insurance proof during the *application* process, not just at signing. Get it now via [Insurance-Guide.ch](https://insurance-guide.ch).

- [ ] **Prepare tenant dossier** — Employment contract, salary slips, references, ID copies
- [ ] **Set alerts on public portals** — Homegate, ImmoScout24 (as backup to Offlist)

### Schools (If Applicable)

- [ ] **Contact international schools** — ZIS, Ecolint, ISBC, etc.
- [ ] **Schedule assessment visits** — Many require in-person evaluations
- [ ] **Submit applications** — Waiting lists are long; apply to multiple schools
- [ ] **Confirm enrollment** — Secure spot with deposit

### Customs Preparation

- [ ] **Prepare Form 18.44** — Swiss customs declaration for household goods
- [ ] **Inventory your belongings** — Detailed list required for duty-free import
- [ ] **Photograph valuables** — Electronics, art, jewelry for insurance
- [ ] **Research car import rules** — If bringing a vehicle

### Form 18.44 Details

| What It Is | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Customs declaration form | Required to import household goods duty-free |
| Lists all items | Must be completed before shipping |
| Proves "change of residence" | Shows you're moving, not just importing goods |

---

## Phase 3: 1 Month Before Departure

### Temporary Housing (If Needed)

If you haven't secured permanent housing via [Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch) yet:

- [ ] **Book a business apartment** — 1-2 month rental for your arrival period
- [ ] **Confirm address for registration** — You need an address to register in Switzerland
- [ ] **Research short-term options** — Serviced apartments, Airbnb (30+ day stays), corporate housing

### Health Insurance Research

You don't need to sign yet, but understand your options:

- [ ] **Read Expat-Savvy.ch guides** — Understand "Franchise" and "Deductibles"
- [ ] **Calculate your expected healthcare usage** — High usage = low franchise; healthy = high franchise
- [ ] **Compare providers** — Same coverage, different prices
- [ ] **Note the 3-month deadline** — Coverage is retroactive from arrival

**[Health Insurance Guide → Expat-Savvy.ch](https://expat-savvy.ch)**

### Moving Logistics

- [ ] **Book moving company** — Get quotes via [Expat-Services Directory](https://expat-services.ch) or through your relocation agency
- [ ] **Confirm shipping dates** — Align with your arrival
- [ ] **Pack non-essential items first** — Leave essentials for carry-on
- [ ] **Arrange pet transport** — Special regulations for animals
- [ ] **Confirm customs documentation** — Form 18.44 complete and ready

### Final Home Country Tasks

- [ ] **Close bank accounts** — Or keep one for trailing expenses
- [ ] **Forward mail** — Set up forwarding service
- [ ] **Say goodbyes** — The emotional part
- [ ] **Final doctor/dentist visits** — Before insurance transition

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How far in advance should I start planning my move to Switzerland?

Start at least 3 months before your intended move date. This allows time for permit processing (2-4 weeks for EU, 2-3 months for non-EU), housing search (often the longest phase in competitive markets), cancelling home country contracts (many require 3 months' notice), and organizing customs documentation.

### What is Form 18.44 for Swiss customs?

Form 18.44 is the customs declaration for importing household goods duty-free when relocating to Switzerland. You must complete it before shipping your belongings and present it at customs upon arrival. It lists all items you're importing and proves you're changing residence, not just importing goods for sale.

### How long do I have to register after arriving in Switzerland?

You must register at your local municipality (Gemeinde/Kreisbüro) within 14 days of arrival. Bring your passport, rental contract, and employment contract. Registration is required to receive your residence permit, open a bank account, and enroll in health insurance.

### When should I start looking for housing in Switzerland?

Start 2-3 months before your move date. In competitive markets like Zürich (0.07% vacancy), the housing search is typically the longest phase of relocation. Register on [Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch) immediately to access off-market inventory and maximize your timeline.

### What should I do in my first week in Switzerland?

Priority tasks in order: Get a Swiss phone number (Day 1), buy an SBB travel card, register at your municipality (within 14 days), open a bank account (requires registration confirmation), and start your health insurance enrollment process. Most essential tasks can be completed in the first few days.

### Do I need temporary housing when moving to Switzerland?

If you haven't secured permanent housing via [Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch) or through an agency, yes — book a "business apartment" or serviced apartment for your first 1-2 months. This gives you a local address for registration, a base for apartment viewings, and breathing room to continue your search.
