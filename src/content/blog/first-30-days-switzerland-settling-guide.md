  - question: "What is the most important task in my first 14 days in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Address registration (Anmeldung) is the most critical task. You must register with your local commune within 14 days of arrival. This is legally mandatory and required for opening bank accounts, getting residence permits, and accessing other services."
  - question: "Can I open a Swiss bank account immediately upon arrival?"
    answer: "You can typically open a bank account within 3-7 days of arrival, but you'll need your address registration (Anmeldung) first. Most banks require your passport, residence permit (or proof of application), address registration, and employment contract."
  - question: "How long do I have to get Swiss health insurance?"
    answer: "You have 3 months from your arrival date to obtain mandatory Swiss health insurance. However, coverage is retroactive to your arrival date, so you'll pay premiums from day one regardless of when you sign up."
  - question: "What should I do if I don't speak German, French, or Italian?"
    answer: "Many services in major cities offer English support. For critical tasks like registration, consider hiring a translator or asking an English-speaking colleague to accompany you. Most banks and mobile providers have English-speaking staff."
  - question: "How much money should I budget for my first month in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Budget CHF 3,000-5,000 for your first month including security deposits (3 months' rent), initial health insurance, temporary housing, and living expenses. Costs vary significantly by region, with Zurich and Geneva being most expensive."
  - question: "When can I expect to receive my residence permit card?"
    answer: "After submitting your application and completing biometrics, residence permit cards typically take 2-8 weeks to arrive, depending on your canton. You'll receive a temporary confirmation that allows you to work and travel meanwhile."
