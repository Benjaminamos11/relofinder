faqs:
  - question: "Why is finding housing in Switzerland so difficult?"
    answer: "Switzerland has the lowest vacancy rates in Europe — as low as 0.06% in Zürich and Zug. This means for every 1,000 apartments, only 6 are available. Public listings receive 100+ applications within hours."
  - question: "What is off-market housing in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Off-market housing refers to apartments and villas that are rented before being publicly listed. These properties circulate through private networks, relocation agencies, and platforms like Offlist.ch — never appearing on Homegate or ImmoScout."
  - question: "What is Offlist.ch?"
    answer: "Offlist.ch is a private marketplace for the Swiss relocation industry. It aggregates pre-market listings from private landlords and departing executives, matching verified tenants based on solvency and employer reputation."
  - question: "How do relocation agencies access off-market inventory?"
    answer: "Top agencies are verified members of private networks like Offlist.ch. They receive listings before public release and can match their clients directly with landlords seeking reliable tenants."
  - question: "Should I hire an agent just to browse Homegate for me?"
    answer: "No. An agent who only monitors public portals provides minimal value — you're still competing with 100+ applicants. Hire an agent specifically for their network access and off-market connections."
  - question: "How do I verify if my agent has off-market access?"
    answer: "Ask directly: 'Are you a verified member of Offlist.ch or similar private networks?' Top agencies will confirm their access and explain how they source inventory beyond public listings."

The number one reason relocations to Switzerland fail is not the job or the culture — it is the housing market.

HR Managers often tell us: *"Our new VP has been in a hotel for 4 months because they can't find a villa."*

If you are hiring a relocation agency via **[ReloFinder](/companies)**, you need to ask them one critical question during the interview:

> **"How do you access off-market inventory?"**

## The Inventory Problem: Executive Summary

| Reality | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **The Stats** | Vacancy rates in major Swiss cities are near zero (0.06% in Zürich). Public listings receive 100+ applications. |
| **The Agent's Role** | You don't hire an agent to browse Homegate for you. You hire them for their *network*. |
| **The Solution** | Top agencies now rely on platforms like **[Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch)** to access inventory before it goes public. |

---

## The Numbers: Why Public Listings Don't Work

### Swiss Vacancy Rates (2025)

| City | Vacancy Rate | What This Means |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Zürich** | 0.07% | 7 apartments per 10,000 are available |
| **Zug** | 0.09% | Wealthy expat concentration drives demand |
| **Geneva** | 0.45% | Better than Zürich, still brutal |
| **Basel** | 0.80% | Pharma hub, slightly easier |
| **Lausanne** | 0.50% | Growing international presence |

**For context:** A healthy rental market has 3-5% vacancy. Switzerland's major cities have 0.1% or less.

### What Happens When a Listing Goes Live

1. **Within 1 hour:** 50+ applications submitted
2. **Within 24 hours:** 100-200+ applications
3. **Viewing slots:** 10-15 maximum
4. **Your odds:** Less than 5% of getting a viewing, less than 1% of signing

**The math is brutal:** If you're an expat competing against 150 Swiss residents with local references, credit history, and existing landlord relationships, you lose.

---

## The "Old Way" vs. The "Network Way"

### The Old Way (Why It Fails)

An agent sets up alerts on public portals. They call the minute an ad goes live. They stand in line with you.

**Result:** You are still competing with the public. The agent just saves you the time of emailing.

| What You Pay | What You Get |
|--------------|--------------|
| CHF 4,000-8,000 | Someone browsing Homegate/ImmoScout24 on your behalf |
| Your time | Endless viewings where you're applicant #147 |
| Hotel costs | Weeks or months of waiting |

**This is the most common mistake.** You hire an expensive agent who has no more access than you do.

### The Network Way (How Top Agencies Win)

The best agencies in our directory have evolved. They leverage technology and private liquidity pools.

Specifically, many of our top-rated partners are verified members of **[Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch)**.

| What You Pay | What You Get |
|--------------|--------------|
| CHF 5,000-10,000 | Access to pre-market inventory |
| Your trust | Properties matched to your profile before they go public |
| One month | Direct introductions to landlords seeking your profile type |

**The difference:** Instead of competing with 150 strangers, you're one of 5-10 pre-qualified candidates receiving a direct invitation.

---

## What is Offlist.ch?

**[Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch)** is the private marketplace for the Swiss relocation industry.

### How It Works

1. **Landlords & Departing Tenants** list properties before going public
2. **Verified Agencies** search for matching tenant profiles
3. **Pre-Qualified Matches** receive direct invitations
4. **Off-Market Transactions** happen quietly, efficiently

### What Makes Offlist Different

| Feature | Public Portals | Offlist.ch |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Listing Source** | Public ads | Pre-market, departing tenants, private landlords |
| **Competition** | 100-200 applicants | 5-10 pre-qualified candidates |
| **Tenant Matching** | First-come, first-served | Solvency, employer reputation, profile fit |
| **Agency Access** | Anyone | Verified relocation professionals only |
| **Timing** | After public listing | Before public listing |

### Who Uses Offlist

- **Relocation Agencies:** To source inventory for corporate clients
- **Private Landlords:** To find reliable tenants without public chaos
- **Departing Executives:** To hand over their apartment to a qualified successor
- **HR Departments:** To secure housing for incoming employees

**Key Insight:** When you hire a Relocation Agent via ReloFinder, you are essentially hiring them to be your proxy on networks like Offlist. They can see the inventory that you, as a private individual, cannot.

## The Agent Selection Framework

When comparing quotes on [ReloFinder](/companies), do not just look at the price. Look at the **access**.

### Questions to Ask Every Agency

| Question | Red Flag Answer | Green Flag Answer |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| "How do you source properties?" | "We monitor all the main portals" | "We're members of Offlist.ch and have direct landlord relationships" |
| "What % of your placements are off-market?" | "We find what's available" | "60-80% of our placements never hit public listings" |
| "Do you have relationships with property managers?" | No specific names | Can name 3-5 institutional partners |
| "What's your average time to placement in Zürich?" | "Depends on the market" | "4-6 weeks for qualified clients" |

### The True Cost Calculation

| Scenario | Agent Cost | Hidden Costs | Total |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Cheap Agent (Portal-Only)** | CHF 4,000 | 3 months hotel @ CHF 5,000/mo = CHF 15,000 | **CHF 19,000** |
| **Premium Agent (Network Access)** | CHF 8,000 | 4 weeks hotel @ CHF 5,000/mo = CHF 1,250 | **CHF 9,250** |

**The "expensive" agent saves you CHF 10,000.**

## How Off-Market Actually Works

### Scenario 1: The Departing Executive

A senior manager at Novartis is returning to Germany. Their landlord doesn't want to list publicly — too much hassle.

**Traditional Path:**
- Landlord lists on Homegate
- Gets 200 applications
- Spends weeks screening
- Picks someone random

**Offlist Path:**
- Departing tenant posts on Offlist
- Agencies match verified candidates
- Landlord receives 5 pre-screened profiles
- Signs with a Roche director within 2 weeks

### Scenario 2: The Private Landlord

A Zürich property owner has a 4.5-room apartment in Enge. They've had bad experiences with public tenants.

**Traditional Path:**
- Lists reluctantly on ImmoScout
- Gets overwhelmed with inquiries
- Can't verify international applicants
- Picks the "safest" local candidate

**Offlist Path:**
- Posts pre-market on Offlist
- Specifies: "Corporate tenant, employer-verified, CHF 150K+ income"
- Agencies present matching profiles
- Signs with a Google engineer sight-unseen (based on verified data)

### Scenario 3: The Corporate Relocation

A pharmaceutical company is moving 15 employees to Basel over 6 months.

**Traditional Path:**
- HR tells employees to find their own housing
- Employees struggle for months
- Productivity suffers
- Some employees decline the transfer

**Offlist Path:**
- Company engages agency with Offlist access
- Agency pre-registers all employee profiles
- As apartments match, employees receive direct invitations
- All 15 placed within 8 weeks

## Regional Deep Dive

### Zürich: The Hardest Market

- **Vacancy:** 0.07%
- **Average Applications:** 150-200 per listing
- **Premium Districts:** Seefeld, Enge, Riesbach — virtually impossible without connections
- **Reality Check:** Corporate executives wait 3-6 months with traditional methods

**Off-Market Advantage:** Essential. Do not attempt Zürich without agency network access.

### Geneva: International but Competitive

- **Vacancy:** 0.45%
- **Average Applications:** 80-120 per listing
- **Premium Districts:** Eaux-Vives, Champel, Cologny

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is finding housing in Switzerland so difficult?

Switzerland has the lowest vacancy rates in Europe — as low as 0.06% in Zürich and Zug. This means for every 1,000 apartments, only 6 are available. Public listings receive 100+ applications within hours, making it nearly impossible for newcomers to compete against established residents with local references.

### What is off-market housing in Switzerland?

Off-market housing refers to apartments and villas that are rented before being publicly listed. These properties circulate through private networks, relocation agencies, and platforms like [Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch) — never appearing on Homegate, ImmoScout24, or other public portals.

### What is Offlist.ch?

[Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch) is a private marketplace for the Swiss relocation industry. It aggregates pre-market listings from private landlords and departing executives, matching verified tenants based on solvency, employer reputation, and profile criteria. Only verified relocation professionals can access the full inventory.

### How do relocation agencies access off-market inventory?

Top agencies are verified members of private networks like Offlist.ch. They receive listings before public release and can match their clients directly with landlords seeking reliable, verified tenants. This is why network access should be a key criterion when selecting an agency.

### Should I hire an agent just to browse Homegate for me?

No. An agent who only monitors public portals provides minimal value — you're still competing with 100+ applicants per listing. The only reason to hire an agent is for their **network access** and off-market connections. Always ask: "Are you a verified member of Offlist.ch?"

### How do I verify if my agent has off-market access?

Ask directly during your consultation:
- "Are you a verified member of Offlist.ch or similar private networks?"
- "What percentage of your placements are off-market?"
- "Can you name specific property managers you work with directly?"

Top agencies will answer confidently. Agencies relying only on public portals will deflect.

## Conclusion

When comparing quotes on ReloFinder, do not just look at the price. Look at the **access**.

- A cheap agent who only checks public websites is expensive in the long run (hotel costs, lost productivity, failed relocations)
- A premium agent connected to the **[Offlist.ch](https://offlist.ch)** ecosystem is an investment in securing a home

**The question isn't "How much does the agent cost?"**

**The question is: "Does the agent have off-market access?"**
