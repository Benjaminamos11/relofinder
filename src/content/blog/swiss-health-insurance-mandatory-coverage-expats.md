faqs:
  - question: "Is health insurance mandatory for expats in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Yes, health insurance is mandatory for all residents in Switzerland, including expats. You must sign up within 3 months of arrival and registration. Coverage is backdated to your arrival date, and failure to register can result in cantonal assignment and penalties."
  - question: "How much does health insurance cost in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Health insurance premiums vary by canton, age, and insurer. Adults typically pay CHF 300-600+ monthly for basic coverage. Premiums are lowest with higher franchise (deductible) options. Children receive subsidized rates, and income-based premium reductions are available for qualifying residents."
  - question: "What is a franchise in Swiss health insurance?"
    answer: "A franchise is your annual deductible (CHF 300-2,500 for adults). You pay all medical costs up to your franchise amount, then 10% of additional costs up to CHF 700 annually. Higher franchise = lower monthly premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs when you need care."
  - question: "Can I choose any health insurance company in Switzerland?"
    answer: "Yes, you can choose any recognized health insurance company (Krankenkasse) operating in your canton. All must accept you regardless of age or health status for basic coverage. Benefits are standardized, but premiums and service levels vary between insurers."
  - question: "What does Swiss basic health insurance cover?"
    answer: "Basic insurance covers doctor visits, hospital treatment (general ward), prescription medications, maternity care, preventive care, and emergency treatment. It does NOT cover routine dental care, glasses, private hospital rooms, or most alternative therapies."
  - question: "What happens if I miss the 3-month health insurance deadline?"
    answer: "If you miss the deadline, the canton will assign you to an insurer, often with higher premiums. You'll face late registration surcharges and have limited choice of providers. Always register within 3 months of arrival to avoid penalties and maintain your freedom of choice."

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions: Swiss Health Insurance for Expats

### **Q1: Can I be refused basic health insurance in Switzerland?**
**A:** **No, absolutely not.** For mandatory basic health insurance (Grundversicherung), all recognized Swiss health insurers must accept anyone who applies, regardless of age, health condition, or pre-existing medical issues, provided you reside in their service area. This is a legal requirement and fundamental principle of the Swiss system.

### **Q2: What happens if I don't get health insurance within 3 months?**
**A:** **Serious consequences await.** The cantonal authorities will:
- **Assign you to an insurer** (often at higher premiums)
- **Require retroactive payment** from your arrival date
- **Impose surcharges** for late registration
- **Limit your choice** of insurance providers
**Prevention is far better than cure** - start the process within your first month.

### **Q3: Can I change my Krankenkasse or franchise easily?**
**A:** **Yes, but with specific timing requirements:**
- **Annual changes only:** Effective January 1st each year
- **November 30th deadline:** Notify current insurer by registered mail
- **Franchise changes:** Often possible with same insurer, similar deadline
- **Model changes:** May be possible mid-year with some insurers
**Planning ahead is essential** - mark these dates in your calendar.

### **Q4: Are dental treatments covered by basic Swiss health insurance?**
**A:** **Generally no, with limited exceptions.** Basic health insurance only covers:
- **Serious diseases** of the masticatory system
- **Severe accidents** affecting teeth
- **Emergency dental pain** treatment
**For routine dental care** (cleanings, fillings, check-ups), you need:
- **Supplementary dental insurance**, or
- **Private payment** for all services
**Plan accordingly** - dental costs can be significant.

### **Q5: My employer offers a 'collective health plan.' Do I still choose my own?**
**A:** **Yes, you still choose your own basic insurance.** Here's why:
- **Individual responsibility:** Basic health insurance is personal, not employment-based
- **Employer offerings:** Usually refer to supplementary insurance discounts
- **Legal requirement:** You must arrange your own mandatory basic coverage
- **Freedom maintained:** You can choose any recognized insurer
**Always clarify** exactly what your employer is offering and ensure you meet your individual legal obligations.

### **Q6: How do I know if I need accident coverage in my health insurance?**
**A:** **Check your employment status:**
- **8+ hours/week with same employer:** Accident coverage included in employment
- **Less than 8 hours/week:** Must add accident coverage to health insurance
- **Self-employed/student/unemployed:** Must add accident coverage
- **Multiple part-time jobs:** Complex - seek professional advice
**When in doubt, add accident coverage** - the cost is minimal compared to the protection.

### **Q7: Can I use my health insurance immediately after signing up?**
**A:** **Yes, but understand the timing:**
- **Coverage starts:** From your arrival date (retroactive)
- **Premium payments:** Due from coverage start date
- **Service access:** Immediate upon registration confirmation
- **Emergency care:** Always covered regardless of registration status
**Keep documentation** of your application and coverage confirmation.
