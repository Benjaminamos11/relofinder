              Generally, you need proof of Swiss residency (residence permit) to open a standard bank account. However, some banks offer account opening for incoming expats with a job contract and proof of relocation. Digital banks like Neon and Yuh may have more flexible requirements. Our partners can help identify banks that accept pre-arrival applications.

              Switzerland levies an annual wealth tax (Vermögenssteuer) on your worldwide assets based on net worth. Rates vary by canton (0.3%-1% typically) with exemptions for lower wealth brackets. This is separate from income tax and applies to savings, investments, real estate, and other assets. Careful tax planning can optimize your wealth tax burden.

              Yes, especially for complex situations. Swiss financial advisors help with tax optimization, investment strategies, retirement planning (pillar 2 & 3a), and navigating Swiss banking requirements. They're particularly valuable for high earners, entrepreneurs, and those with international assets. The cost typically pays for itself through tax savings and optimized financial planning.

              Traditional banks (UBS, Credit Suisse, PostFinance) offer full services, physical branches, and personal advisors but charge higher fees. Digital banks (Neon, Yuh, Revolut) have lower/no fees, mobile-first interfaces, but limited services and no physical branches. Choose based on your needs: digital for simplicity and cost savings, traditional for comprehensive services and in-person support.

              Digital banks: 1-7 days with online application. Traditional banks: 1-3 weeks including in-person appointment, document verification, and compliance checks. Expedited services through relocation partners can reduce wait times significantly. Having all documents prepared in advance speeds up the process considerably.

              Yes, extremely safe. Swiss banks are protected by deposit insurance (esisuisse) covering up to CHF 100,000 per bank. Switzerland has strong banking regulations, political stability, and a long tradition of banking security, making it one of the world's safest banking systems. Expats enjoy the same protections as Swiss citizens.
