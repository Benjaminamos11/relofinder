          <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p>
              The Swiss housing market is notoriously difficult for expats. <strong>Zurich and Geneva have vacancy rates under 0.5%</strong>, 
              creating intense competition for every available apartment. The average search takes 2-3 months, and many expats struggle 
              with language barriers, unfamiliar rental procedures, and strict landlord requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Switzerland's housing shortage affects all major cities. In <a href="/locations/zurich" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Zurich</a>, 
              apartments receive dozens of applications within hours of listing. <a href="/locations/geneva" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Geneva</a>'s 
              international community competes for limited housing stock. Even in smaller cities like <a href="/locations/basel" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Basel</a> 
              and <a href="/locations/zug" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Zug</a>, finding suitable housing requires local knowledge and quick action.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rental process in Switzerland differs significantly from other countries. Most apartments are unfurnished – often without 
              light fixtures, kitchen appliances, or even kitchen cabinets. Landlords require extensive documentation including employment 
              contracts, salary slips, debt collection certificates, and previous landlord references. Understanding these requirements 
              is crucial for expats seeking to find a flat in Switzerland.

            <p>
              <strong>Temporary housing Switzerland</strong> provides crucial flexibility when you first arrive. Furnished apartments 
              offer immediate accommodation without the long-term commitment of standard Swiss leases. Most temporary housing includes 
              furniture, kitchen equipment, and utilities – perfect for expats needing time to find permanent accommodation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Short-term options include serviced apartments, corporate housing, and sublets. Costs are higher than standard rentals 
              (typically 30-50% premium), but provide essential breathing room during your apartment search. Many expats use temporary 
              housing for 1-3 months while viewing apartments and completing applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our housing specialists connect you with reputable temporary housing providers and help negotiate flexible terms. We also 
              assist with sublet agreements, ensuring legal compliance and protecting your interests. Learn more about short-term options

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How hard is it to find an apartment in Zurich?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Finding an apartment in Zurich is highly competitive with vacancy rates under 0.5%. The average search takes 2-3 months. 
                Most apartments receive dozens of applications within 24 hours of listing. Using a <strong>relocation agency Zurich</strong> 
                specialists gives you access to off-market listings from expats leaving Switzerland, significantly reducing search time 
                and improving your chances of securing quality housing.

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can expats rent without a Swiss work contract?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Most Swiss landlords require a valid work contract and residence permit before approving rental applications. Some landlords 
                accept international contracts if you have a confirmed <a href="/services/visa" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">work permit application</a> 
                in process. <strong>Temporary housing</strong> and furnished apartments typically have more flexible requirements for new arrivals. 
                Corporate housing providers specifically cater to expats in transition periods.

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What's included in furnished housing in Switzerland?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Furnished apartments Switzerland</strong> typically include bed, sofa, dining table, chairs, basic kitchen appliances 
                (stove, refrigerator), and sometimes linens and dishware. In contrast, standard Swiss rentals are completely unfurnished – 
                often without light fixtures, kitchen appliances, or even kitchen cabinets. Furnished options cost 30-50% more but provide 
                immediate livability for expats and are ideal for temporary stays while searching for permanent housing.

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How long does the rental process take?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The <strong>Swiss lease application process</strong> takes 1-2 weeks once you submit your application. Landlords review 
                multiple candidates, conduct credit checks via the debt collection registry (Betreibungsregister), and verify employment. 
                Some landlords conduct personal interviews. Move-in typically occurs 1-3 months after application approval, depending on 
                the apartment's availability date. Having all documents prepared accelerates the process significantly.

              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Documents needed for Swiss rental applications:</strong> valid ID or passport, residence/work permit, employment 
                contract, last 3 months salary slips, debt collection certificate (Betreibungsregisterauszug - must be less than 3 months old), 
                previous landlord reference if available, and sometimes a credit report. International applicants may need additional documentation.

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What are the best platforms to find apartments in Switzerland?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Popular platforms include Homegate.ch, ImmoScout24.ch, and Comparis.ch. However, the best apartments rarely reach public 
                listings. <strong>Off-market apartments</strong> are typically found through personal networks, company relocations, or 
                relocation agencies. Our specialists provide early access to listings from expats leaving Switzerland, giving you a significant 
                advantage in this competitive market. This insider access is particularly valuable in high-demand areas like Zurich and Geneva.
