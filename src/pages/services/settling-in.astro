              Depends on your nationality. <strong>EU/EFTA licenses:</strong> valid for 12 months, then exchange at Strassenverkehrsamt (no test required). <strong>Non-EU:</strong> valid 12 months, then must pass Swiss theory and practical driving tests. Exchange process varies by canton. Some countries have bilateral agreements allowing direct exchange. Start early as appointments can take weeks and theory tests are only offered in German, French, or Italian.
