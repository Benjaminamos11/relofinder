              Standard Zurich rentals are unfurnished, often without light fixtures, kitchen appliances (except stove), or kitchen cabinets in older buildings. Budget CHF 5,000-15,000 for furnishing. Furnished apartments are rare, expensive (30-50% premium), and have shorter leases. Temporary corporate housing fills the gap but costs CHF 3,000-5,000/month for a basic apartment.

              The Gold Coast (Goldküste) - Küsnacht, Meilen, Zollikon - has sunny south-facing exposure and premium rents (CHF 2,400-4,500 for 2.5-3.5 rooms). Extremely competitive with long wait lists. The Silver Coast (Silberküste) - Horgen, Thalwil, Rüschlikon - is more family-friendly with slightly better availability (CHF 1,900-3,600) but still competitive.

                <strong>Without agency support, Zurich apartment searches typically take 3-6 months</strong> with high frustration levels. Many expats settle for suboptimal locations or overpay for temporary housing. Relocation agencies with off-market access (apartments from departing expats) reduce search time to 4-8 weeks and secure better properties through landlord relationships and professional presentation.
