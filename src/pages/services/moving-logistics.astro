            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Swiss rental contracts have strict handover dates with no flexibility. International shipping timelines (4-12 weeks) don't always align perfectly. Coordination gaps mean temporary storage or rushed moving decisions. Late delivery can breach rental agreements or leave you without furniture.

              Most Swiss buildings require advance elevator reservations and building insurance proof. City parking permits for moving trucks must be secured 1-2 weeks ahead (CHF 50-150). Without permits, trucks can't access buildings, movers can't work, and you face fines. Coordination with building management is mandatory.

              International moves involve multiple parties across borders: origin mover, shipping company, customs brokers, destination mover, building management. Communication gaps cause missed deliveries, damaged goods, or lost items. Language barriers add complexity when coordinating with Swiss partners.

                <strong>Without professional coordination, expats often:</strong> Miss customs documents causing weeks of delays and storage fees, book moves without elevator access forcing manual carrying, underinsure valuable items leading to financial losses, forget parking permits resulting in fines and failed move-ins, or prepare pet documents incorrectly risking entry refusal.

              Yes, two types: <strong>Moving insurance</strong> covers goods in transit (highly recommended for international moves, typically 1-3% of declared value). <strong>Building/liability insurance</strong> is mandatory in most Swiss buildings during move-in/move-out to protect against damage to common areas, elevators, walls, floors. Buildings require proof of coverage before allowing moving truck access. Professional movers include this in quotes.

              Yes, parking permits (Parkplatz-Reservation) are <strong>required in most Swiss cities</strong> including Zurich, Geneva, Basel, and Bern. Apply 1-2 weeks in advance through city authorities (<strong>CHF 50-150 fee</strong>). Some buildings require elevator reservations separately. Without permits, moving trucks risk fines (CHF 100-200) and towing, causing major delays. Professional movers handle permit applications as part of moving coordination.

              Yes, short-term storage (<strong>1-6 months typical</strong>) is common for Switzerland moves. Useful when: move-out and move-in dates don't align, housing search takes longer than expected, temporary accommodation before permanent housing. Costs vary by volume and duration (<strong>CHF 100-500/month</strong> for typical household). Climate-controlled options available for sensitive items. Most moving companies offer integrated storage solutions near Swiss entry points.
