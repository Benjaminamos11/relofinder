## 📊 Answer to Your Questions

### **Q1: Are all profiles now like this the same when we deploy?**

**✅ YES!** All 36 agency profiles use this same template:

- Same tier logic (Standard/Partner/Preferred)

**Dynamic parts:**
- Agency name, description, services, regions (from content collections)
- Tier (from Supabase `relocators` table)

### **Q2: Do all profiles have reviews and AI function?**

**Reviews:**

- ❌ Shows "No reviews yet" if no data

**AI Function:**
