# ‚úÖ Reviews Integration Complete

## What We've Done

### 1. **Removed Pricing from FAQs** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
- **Before**: FAQs included "How much does Prime Relocation charge?" with specific pricing (CHF 3,500, CHF 8,900)
- **After**: Removed all pricing information from FAQs
- **New FAQs**: Focus on regions, services, languages, response times, and capabilities
- Updated in: `src/content/companies/prime-relocation.md`

### 2. **Added Placeholder AI Summary** ‚úÖ
- Always visible under the hero section
- Shows either:
  - **Real summary** (if exists in `review_summaries` table)
  - **Placeholder** with generic strengths: "Professional Service", "Local Expertise", "Comprehensive Support"
- Clearly labeled as placeholder when no real data

### 3. **Integrated Google Reviews** ‚úÖ
We're now showing the **62 Google reviews** we already have from SerpAPI!

#### Data Flow:
```
SerpAPI ‚Üí external_reviews table ‚Üí payload (JSONB) ‚Üí Extract & Display
```

#### What's Displayed:
- **Review count**: "62 from Google Business"
- **Rating**: 4.8/5 stars (in hero metrics)
- **Individual reviews**: Up to 10 Google reviews with:
  - Author name
  - Star rating
  - Review text
  - Date
  - "Google Review" badge
  - Google logo badge at bottom

#### Review Display Structure:
1. **User Reviews Section** (0 currently - from ReloFinder)
2. **Google Reviews Section** (62 reviews - from SerpAPI)
3. Both combined in one list
4. Clear visual distinction with badges

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Google reviews count (62) displayed
- Weighted rating shown (4.8/5)
- Placeholder AI summary visible
- FAQ section (6 questions, NO pricing)
- Review distribution stats
- Empty state for user reviews

### üîÑ To Verify
**Run this SQL in Supabase to check the review data structure:**

```sql
-- Check external reviews payload
SELECT 
  er.rating,
  er.review_count,
  jsonb_typeof(er.payload->'reviews') as reviews_type,
  er.payload->'reviews'->0 as first_review_sample
FROM external_reviews er
JOIN relocators r ON r.id = er.relocator_id
WHERE r.name ILIKE '%prime%'
ORDER BY er.captured_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

The payload structure should be:
```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {
      "user": { "name": "Author Name" },
      "rating": 5,
      "snippet": "Review text here...",
      "date": "2 months ago"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**If the payload structure is different**, we may need to adjust the extraction logic in `/src/pages/companies/[id].astro` lines 67-76.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Google Reviews Don't Show

**Problem**: Reviews distribution shows "62 from Google Business" but no review cards below

**Check 1**: Verify payload structure
```sql
SELECT payload FROM external_reviews 
WHERE relocator_id = (SELECT id FROM relocators WHERE name ILIKE '%prime%')
ORDER BY captured_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Check 2**: Look for the review extraction code
File: `/src/pages/companies/[id].astro`
Lines: 67-76

Current extraction assumes this structure:
- `payload.reviews[]`
- `review.user.name`
- `review.rating`
- `review.snippet` or `review.text`
- `review.date`

**Fix**: If structure is different, update the mapping logic:
```javascript
externalReviews = externalData.payload.reviews.slice(0, 10).map((review: any) => ({
  author_name: review.user?.name || review.author_name || 'Google User',
  rating: review.rating || 5,
  body: review.snippet || review.text || review.comment || '',
  created_at: review.date || review.time || externalData.captured_at,
  source: 'google'
}));
```

### If AI Summary Shows Placeholder Forever

**Add a real summary** (run in Supabase):
```sql
INSERT INTO public.review_summaries (
  relocator_id,
  summary,
  positives,
  negatives,
  internal_review_count,
  external_review_count,
  weighted_rating,
  last_generated_at
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM relocators WHERE name ILIKE '%prime%'),
  'Prime Relocation consistently receives high marks from clients for their professional service and local expertise. Clients particularly appreciate their responsiveness and comprehensive support throughout the relocation process.',
  ARRAY['Professional team', 'Quick responses', 'Local knowledge', 'Comprehensive support', 'Family-friendly'],
  ARRAY['Premium pricing', 'Occasional delays'],
  0,
  62,
  4.8,
  NOW()
)
ON CONFLICT (relocator_id) DO UPDATE SET
  summary = EXCLUDED.summary,
  positives = EXCLUDED.positives,
  negatives = EXCLUDED.negatives,
  external_review_count = EXCLUDED.external_review_count,
  weighted_rating = EXCLUDED.weighted_rating;
```
